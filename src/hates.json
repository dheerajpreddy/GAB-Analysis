Many have asked us about a \u201cblock\u201d button, something we have been fervently against for many reasons. First: block buttons create echo chambers. When you block someone on Twitter you no longer see ideas that you may disagree with. You put up a shield and hide in a bubble of people you agree with. It is lunacy that PUBLIC content can no longer be seen by certain individuals just because you disagree with them.\u00a0\n\r\nThat being said, having experienced the nastiness of the internet first hand for years, I fully understand someone\u2019s need to disassociate themselves from people who cyber stalk them or harass them extremely nonstop. My own family and I have experienced this dozens of times. Ultimately, Gab wants to give you the individual as much freedom and choice over your own experience as possible.\n\r\nThe concept of a ban button for you as a user would be simple: if you ban someone from your Gab content, they can no longer comment on your posts. They can still view your public content, because it is public. They can still quote your public content and give their own commentary to their own followers. This is not a new concept and it works well in other\u00a0online communities.\u00a0\n\r\nWe would love to hear your thoughts on this concept, which would be separate from our current mute button and offer a middle-ground for not having a block button.", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.08417179922060107}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.39661886494507104}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.5192093358343278}]}, {"text": "One of the photos taken on my recent trip to England - this one was taken in the picturesque village of Finchingfield , in Essex - nice windmill , doncha think ?!!!", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.03481484910724493}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.37691194985730503}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.5882732010354501}]}, {"text": "I hope motorcycles are allowed here!", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.23815014408433638}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.1301457304880791}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.6317041254275846}]}, {"text": "66 Stingray that my grandpa has been working on.

We've also added 20,000 new users this week alone powered by\u00a0our successful marketing campaign in Silicon Valley. We are incredibly excited to keep building the home of free speech online powered by The People. In the coming weeks we have some great product improvements on the way that we can't wait to share with you.\u00a0\n\r\nI'm excited to announce that we will finally be 100% off of Microsoft Azure hosting and fully transitioned to our new more scalable provider this week. We will also soon be shipping Gab in Portuguese for our users in Brazil, who now make up 25%+ of our traffic. Finally, we expect to be opening up our API in the next week after a year in private testing with a small group of trusted developers. This will allow third-party developers to build apps and integrations connected to Gab and we can't wait to see what our community builds.\u00a0\n\r\nI wanted to address some misinformation and questions being asked and asserted about our campaign. Many of these items are disclosed and discussed in our offering circular, but I believe it's important to share this information in an update as well.\n\r\nFirst, investing in an early stage startup involves extreme risk. There are no guarantees of success, but we are working hard daily to build and grow our community and business while defending free expression online for all people. We have highlighted many of the risks involved in\u00a0our offering circular, which we encourage you all to read before investing.\n\r\nSecondly, I want to make a clear distinction between total number of Gab users and monthly active Gab users. People use Gab in many different ways. Some people spend many hours per day on Gab, others check Gab once a day, once a week, or once a month. Many more people do not have accounts, but rather view and read Gab's public-facing content which drives traffic to the site.\n\r\nAs is mentioned in our Offering Circular, we had over 660,000 cumulative registered users from around the world and approximately 250,000 of those logged in during the 30 days prior to the filing. We have been steadily improving our monthly active user count as we have made more improvements to the product and will be working on reengagement campaigns with inactive accounts in the near future. As you all know we have also worked hard and been very transparent about removing bots and fake accounts from the platform, banning well over 80,000 of them this year alone.\u00a0\n\r\nFinally, the growth of traffic to the site can be confirmed by two independent third-party providers. While not exact, these both offer some insight into our growth beyond our own internal metrics, which are found in the Offering Circular.\u00a0\n\r\nAlexa:\u00a0https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/gab.ai\n\r\nSimilarweb:\u00a0https://www.similarweb.com/website/gab.ai#overview\n\r\nThank you all for your continued support. We have been attacked from many angles by the media, from competitors, political activists, special interests, and generally bitter people who just want to see us fail. Despite these attacks we continue to build, learn, and grow the home of free speech powered by The People to defend free expression online for everyone.\u00a0\n\r\nI want you all to know that Ekrem(@e) and I see Gab as our life's work and our team is so inspired and humbled to serve you for this noble cause on this incredible journey together.

Many have asked us about a \u201cblock\u201d button, something we have been fervently against for many reasons. First: block buttons create echo chambers. When you block someone on Twitter you no longer see ideas that you may disagree with. You put up a shield and hide in a bubble of people you agree with. It is lunacy that PUBLIC content can no longer be seen by certain individuals just because you disagree with them.\u00a0\n\r\nThat being said, having experienced the nastiness of the internet first hand for years, I fully understand someone\u2019s need to disassociate themselves from people who cyber stalk them or harass them extremely nonstop. My own family and I have experienced this dozens of times. Ultimately, Gab wants to give you the individual as much freedom and choice over your own experience as possible.\n\r\nThe concept of a ban button for you as a user would be simple: if you ban someone from your Gab content, they can no longer comment on your posts. They can still view your public content, because it is public. They can still quote your public content and give their own commentary to their own followers. This is not a new concept and it works well in other\u00a0online communities.\u00a0\n\r\nWe would love to hear your thoughts on this concept, which would be separate from our current mute button and offer a middle-ground for not having a block button.", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.08417179922060107}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.39661886494507104}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.5192093358343278}]}, {"text": "\ud83d\udc9c", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.03945320844208391}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.33037608806864915}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.630170703489267}]}, {"text": "Very nice new stainless steel mugs https://shop.gab.com/products/stainless-steel-gab-com-travel-mug", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.04046008569381643}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.3058411489975549}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.6536987653086288}]}, {"text": "I am job hunting and I have excellent credentials.

You have now officially neutered the argument, \"They have Pepe as a logo, so dey (((raycissssssss)))!\"\n\r\n2. Branding to display your readable name in a clear, legible font was a very good move. Now, people don't need knowledge when looking at screenshots - it's right there: GAB (get on it!)\n\r\n3. The performance of the site now that you're off Azure is stunning. You made the move for the right reasons and it really worked out all around. Moves like this are always huge risks. The team nailed it.\n\r\n4. The recent improvements to the UX are appreciated. Feels like you're nailing things down and they're being allowed to get better while having fewer bugs.\n\r\n5. The diversity of the user base (along many axes) is NOTICEABLY expanded. Many new topics are being discussed, and people are sharing from all over the world. Engagement has gone up for everyone from what I can see.\n\r\n6.

Injunctions that prohibit the Executive Branch from applying a law or policy against anyone\u2014often called \u201cuniversal\u201d or \u201cnationwide\u201d injunctions\u2014have become increasingly common.1 District courts, including the one here, have begun imposing universal injunctions without considering their authority to grant such sweeping relief. These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system\u2014 preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch. I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions. These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts. If their popularity continues, this Court must address their legality.\n\r\n\u2026\n\r\nIn sum, universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious.

And, what you've managed to accomplish on the resources you have is a case study in some kinda somethin' :)\n\r\n1. I loved and will miss Gabby. But, dropping the frog was a great move. Many reasons. You have now officially neutered the argument, \"They have Pepe as a logo, so dey (((raycissssssss)))!\"\n\r\n2. Branding to display your readable name in a clear, legible font was a very good move. Now, people don't need knowledge when looking at screenshots - it's right there: GAB (get on it!)\n\r\n3. The performance of the site now that you're off Azure is stunning. You made the move for the right reasons and it really worked out all around. Moves like this are always huge risks. The team nailed it.\n\r\n4. The recent improvements to the UX are appreciated. Feels like you're nailing things down and they're being allowed to get better while having fewer bugs.\n\r\n5. The diversity of the user base (along many axes) is NOTICEABLY expanded. Many new topics are being discussed, and people are sharing from all over the world. Engagement has gone up for everyone from what I can see.\n\r\n6. Switching to a .com domain, whatever the hell that cost you...was worth it.\n\r\n7. Investing in Progressive Web App status for the site on iOS (a thing we've had on Android for a while, now) was absolutely worth it. Only seems silly until you launch it and see the change in traffic and engagement.\n\r\n8. The EU has been told to suck dicks again (memes). Quite simply: Thank you for being a US corporation with the balls to tell governing bodies to eat shit-flavored ice cream!\n\r\nI'm sure I've missed some things, but what a list! About 2-3 months back, I said Gab was on a trajectory in favorable market conditions to utterly take over in 6-9 months if it held course and kept improving. Gab is holding course, and keeps improving. Twitter/Facebook/Google keep banning. This is good. For Gab!\n\r\nExpect Twitter, Facebook, and Google to actually start taking the threat seriously.

Ultimately, Gab wants to give you the individual as much freedom and choice over your own experience as possible.\n\r\nThe concept of a ban button for you as a user would be simple: if you ban someone from your Gab content, they can no longer comment on your posts. They can still view your public content, because it is public. They can still quote your public content and give their own commentary to their own followers. This is not a new concept and it works well in other\u00a0online communities.\u00a0\n\r\nWe would love to hear your thoughts on this concept, which would be separate from our current mute button and offer a middle-ground for not having a block button.", "top_class": "neither", "classes": [{"class_name": "hate_speech", "confidence": 0.08417179922060107}, {"class_name": "offensive_language", "confidence": 0.39661886494507104}, {"class_name": "neither", "confidence": 0.5192093358343278}]}, {"text": "My advice is.
